Please revise the code to fix this issue. DO NOT retry the same code blindly. If the error was due to a missing `api.` prefix or invalid function call, correct that first.

Also, if the task was a simple request (e.g., showing the pointed coordinate), make sure to only call `api.get_fingertip_position()` and print it â€” do not execute scanning or polishing steps unnecessarily.
